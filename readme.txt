This plugin will scan your plugins (and WordPress) version for more then 3000+ known vulnerabilities and exploits.

== Description ==

Plugin made to ease the process of keeping your site safe (from potential exploits/vulnerabilities in WordPress or plugins).

<strong>Anyone can use it, no coding skills required</strong>, just <strong>click "Scan"</strong> (next to "Add New" in the Plugins section in WordPress)
and you will get an immediate report for all of your currently installed plugins - which one is vulnerable and which one
is safe.

No need to monitor 20 websites and receive 100+ emails (from groups and newsletters) so that you can keep up to date
with the <strong>latest vulnerabilities in WordPress and its related plugins... our team will do that for you</strong>!

Note: Currently, we are limiting the number of scan per day (per ip/site) to 10, mainly because we want to protect our
servers from getting hammered by bad users. In the future we will most likely remove this limitation, but until then,
please remember that this is a <strong>free plugin</strong> and despite that it costs us <strong>tons of hours (of processing emails, data,
reviewing plugins, exploits/vulnerabilities, developing and maintaining this plugin)</strong> we will try to <strong>always have a
free version that helps the WordPress community to protect their sites</strong>.

1. Install via wordpress.org
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

as the scan finishes.
